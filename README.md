# BarBot Mobile Application
BarBot Mobile allows consumers to interact with BarBot machines on their smart phones. After signing up with Google, Facebook or E-mail, users can search for nearby BarBot locations, browse drink menus and create custom drinks. Enter payment info once using Apply Pay, Android Pay, Venmo or Credit/Debit, and never forget to close your tab again. Skip lines at the bar by ordering from the app, and pouring from a BarBot machine. BarBot Mobile allows the best experience for those looking for that perfectly mixed cocktail!
